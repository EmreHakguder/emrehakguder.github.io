                <u><b>REWRITE ALL THIS</b></u><br><br>
                I'm a linguistics Ph.D. and a multidisciplinary designer.
                I've worked on many projects as a computational linguist,
                an interior designer,
                architectural assistant and visualization artist,
                <br><br>

                
                Emre Hakgüder grew up in Bursa, Turkey.
                During his college education at Bahçesehir
                University in Istanbul, where he studied
                Advertising, he moved to Vilnius, Lithuania
                as an exchange student for one year. Following
                his graduation, he moved to Florence, Italy
                for his graduate education in Graphic Design.
                Upon returning to Turkey, he worked with many
                design studios and architecture firms as a 
                graphic designer and a 3D architectural visualization
                artist. In 2011, he decided to pursue a graduate
                degree in Linguistics, his childhood dream,
                and started school again at Bogaziçi University
                in Istanbul while continuing his design work.
                He was introduced to Turkish Sign Language there and 
                wrote his master's thesis on its snytax. In 2015,
                he started his doctoral studies at the University
                of Chicago Linguistics Program. He currently resides
                in West Loop, Chicago. <br>
